        <p>
          I spent most of my childhood gaming between consoles and computers.
          For most of my middle life I lost touch with a computer, but stayed
          very involved in the gaming community. While gaming in 2013 I came in
          contact with todays leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. This has kept a
          constant flame going for a desire to get back into computers.
          Bartending was a passion for many many years, but I decided to put
          down the bottles and take a leap into web development in 2021.
